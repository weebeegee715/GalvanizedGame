argument!!

v You're going to see Heinrich again, I presume?

1. Well, yes. I don't know why you say it like that. (+1)
    v Like what?
    m like _that!_ 
2. No... (-1)
    v And now you are _lying_ about it? 
    m what do you want me to _say_, Val?!
3. I have to be confidential about these things, Val. (0)
    3. I know, I know... But it _is_ him though?
    Val, I cant _do_ this with you!

m He's a patient of mine, you understand that? I'm his doctor. 

v I know that? What the hell are we even talking about Emie, you can go!

m I *can* go! You don't need to tell me! Why are you being so weird about this?

v He tried to kill me. I can be weird about it, Mira. 

1.You tried to kill him too. (-1)

    -okay?? Was I supposed to coddle him when he was trying to my eye out of my skull? Please.

    "You hurt him more than he hurt you."

    Poor little _Jaeger_. It's their job to get mangled, Mira. They kill monsters for a living, it's not exactly a safe _job!.

    And you just get to do that? Mangle people?

    If someone turns a sword to me? I am well within my right, _Miracolina!_ (points like -3 jump LARGE argue)

2.You act as if these men know better!  (0)
    m They don't _know_ better Val! Do you _know_ the lies they spout to them?
    v Oh, they blame me for _everything_ under the sun! Anyone foolish enough to blame every little problem on me without a lick of proof and then _kill_ me for it deserves everything they get.

    1. How awful can you be?! (-1)
    v _Very._

    2. You can't think like that Val! You're better than that. (0)
    v _I'm not._

    I tire of this.

    _You're_ tired?! you? You don't get to just be this way and then decide you're bored of it!

    I'll do what I damn well please, Mira. 

    > Not to me you won't!
    "You don't get to treat to treat me this way! _What's wrong with you?!_"
    > What is your _problem?_
    "What the hell is _wrong with you?_

    >...wrong with me? (-1 Overarching Points)

    You are geniunely treating me like some kind of promiscuous _harlot_ because I have to interact with men? for my job?!

    > I didn't say that...

    Speaking _of_ my job, you hardly respect what I do and I haven't the slightest clue _WHY!_

    > <:c

    You spend your days in lovely house on this estate, you have this lovely place all to yourself, and you _still_ make the concious effort to
    be utterly _horrible_ to the few people who can bare to hold a conversation with you!

    > You are yelling at me.... <:c

    You have got to be one of the most _awful_ people I've ever met! I am off to tell a  he is never to walk again because you, _YOU_ 
    shattered his legs in so very _many_ places that there is nothing I can do!
    He never, _never_ wanted to hunt a day in his life, but he did! He was just pushed and pushed into it!

    > ... D:>

    These men think you are a monster and you've never thought for one second to prove them wrong! Because you _can't!_, because that is who you are! 
    Because that is _what_ you are!

Regular Argue (these buttons are real!)

    m Val, why are you always like this with me?

    v Like what?

    m Like _this!_ You act like you're so cavalier about everything -- I'm trying to have a serious conversation with you, Val!

    v I don't _wan't_ to have a serious conversation with you. So I will not have it.
    I value your knowledge, not your _opinion of me._ Do you forget yourself?

    m Forget myself? Do I have not have the _privelege_ of speaking with you? Do you hold me in such low regard? 

    v ... >=c

    v You are here for one reason and one reason alone. I am _going_ to learn enough alchemy from you, until I soon, _and it will be very soon_ begin to teach myself

    v And in this meantime, this bothersome period where I have to deal with you, I will not be lectured abour every little percieved moral failure you see in me!

    m And who are you to speak to me like this? Do you think you're better than me?!

    v You think you ar.

    m ... <:c

    m You're being awful to me. I'm going home.

    v leaving _how?_ Don't expect me to walk you over there before you've explained these damned tomes to me.
        
        m You can't make me. I have two good legs and soul free of whatever bullshit magic keeps _you_ here.
        
        v _Good for you!~_ So free to let yourself be chased halfway across Ibleheim by a bunch of _men!_ 
        Not wizards or anything, just some guys with pointy sticks and useless books

        m So "useless" for you to be begging for me to teach them to you?

        v Beg! I do not beg. I take what I want.

        m And what _do_ you want? Barrels of ale and piles of gold? Piles of _girls?_

        v >:m No! (//>n<//)

        m Look at you. You act like this for hardly any reason and the notion that I deserve an apology 
        will never cross your mind!

        v I will not be lectured in my own home!

        m You will not! I am leaving! You won't hear any more from me!

        v Well fine! I'll figure this out myself!

        m You will! You child! Poison yourself and see if I care! I'm off to talk to _other_ people!

        v I _prefer_ being alone.

        v _I prefer being alone.._

    1. How would I be running a practice if they thought _I_ was dead?

        v I don't think much of your job. It bores me.
        > excuse me?
            v you're excused.
            m and you aren't funny.
        
    2. Must you be so _morbid_ about everything.

        v But {bt}Miraa{bt}, am I not morbid in my very nature?
        m You're not funny.
    
    m Does everything have to be like this with you? Just a big joke?

    v I just don't take this topic particularly seriously seriously.

    m But I _do!_ You need to stop! Do you _know_ how badly you hurt Heinrich? _Do you?_

    v Quite, I presume? 

    1. m are you proud to have broken a man's legs? (0)

        v Well, if you put it like that...
        m yes, im _putting_ it like that. It's not funny! _You're_ not funny!
        m I have to tell this man that he is never going to walk again, and in all my miracle magical garbage there
        is nothing more I could _ever_ do for someone who has been hurt that _badly!_  
        m {sc}and I have so sit here and listen to you try joke about it? You're just awful..{/sc}

    2. m What the hell is your _problem?_ (-1)

        v My _problem?_
        m Do you not understand this is serious? Or do you just not _care?!_, do you not care I have to tell a man that
        I don't know if he'll ever walk again?
        m {sc}Do you care about anyone but yourself? How awful can you be?{/sc}

    v Mira, wait... <:c 
    m I'm going into the city, I have a patient to see.
    v That's quite the walk to take yourself-
    m And that's exactly what I'll do!
