argument!!

You're going to see Heinrich again, I presume?

Well, yes. I don't know why you say it like that.

Like what?

He's a patient of mine, you understand that? I'm his doctor. 

I know that? What the hell are we even talking about Emie, you can go!

I *can* go! You don't need to tell me! You are always so weird about this?

He tried to kill me. I can be weird about it, Mira. 

You tried to kill him too. 

O-okay?? Was I supposed to coddle him when he was trying to my eye out of my skull? Please.

I didn't say that. I am the only practicioner that will work a mile near this place and I have seen men try and fail to kill you.
I know how it looks. It doesn't look like _that!_
